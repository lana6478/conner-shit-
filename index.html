        <ul class="timeline" aria-live="polite">
          <li>
            <strong>April, Year Unknown — Incident One</strong>
            <div class="muted">Guests recalled the lights flickering as the last show ended. A child followed what they described as a "warm humming" into the service hall. When staff reviewed the cameras, frames were missing—corrupted—and the yellow rabbit was seen facing the wrong direction between cuts.</div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>June — Incident Two</strong>
            <div class="muted">Maintenance reported finding deep scratches on the inside of the rabbit's suit casing. That same week, a young guest disappeared near the photo booth. Witnesses described hearing tapping from inside the stage lift long after power was shut off.</div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>August — Incident Three</strong>
            <div class="muted">Two teens attempting to film an after-hours exploration vanished. Their camera was recovered, its final footage showing the rabbit jerking toward the lens in a series of unnatural, stuttering motions—almost as if someone inside was trying to get out.</div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>October — Incident Four</strong>
            <div class="muted">A night guard left a panicked voice message claiming the rabbit "stood by the office door even though it hadn't moved in years." He resigned and fled town the next morning; his belongings and badge remained untouched in his locker.</div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>December — Incident Five</strong>
            <div class="muted">During an overnight inspection, emergency responders discovered the rabbit suit propped upright in the main dining room. The suit was warm to the touch despite the building losing heat hours earlier. An inspector later reported hearing slow breathing from inside the suit when alone.</div>

        <h3>Key Figure — "Sunny" the Yellow Rabbit <span class="bunny-eye blink" title="the yellow rabbit"></span></h3>
        <div class="character">
          <div class="avatar yellow" aria-hidden="true">SR</div>
          <div>
            <p class="muted">Originally built as a cheerful party host, Sunny became infamous after staff discovered its internal memory core had logged unauthorized "manual overrides" long after its operator key was retired. Some claim the rabbit reacts to names spoken near it.</p>
            <p><strong>Role</strong>: Stage mascot, photo-op host</p>
            <p><strong>Behavior Shift</strong>: Recorded audio tests captured faint whisper-like interference—rhythmic, deliberate, almost responsive.</p>
            <p><strong>Rumor</strong>: Technicians believed a person may have hidden inside the suit months before the incidents began, but no proof was ever found.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
          <div>
            <p class="muted">Known in the original show lineup as a cheerful mascot, in this version "Sunny" is central to the mystery. Folks say Sunny's wiring remembered more than it should.</p>
            <p><strong>Role</strong>: Stage mascot, photo-op host</p>
            <p><strong>Mystery</strong>: Could an animatronic remember or replay moments of the past? Witness accounts and damaged recordings leave more questions than answers.</p>

      <h3>Short Notes & Theories</h3>
      <ul>
        <li class="muted">Theory: Sunny’s early prototype contained an abandoned "presence mimicry" module—meant to record and mirror performer movements. Its last rehearsal recording was corrupted, looping a single figure stepping into frame.</li>
        <li class="muted">Theory: Backstage microphones picked up soft knocking patterns after hours, matching the rhythm of a child’s game played earlier that day.</li>
        <li class="muted">Theory: Management ordered several incident reports shredded. Employees insist the suit occasionally shifts position when no one is watching.</li>
